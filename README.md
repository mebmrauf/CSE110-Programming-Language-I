# CSE 110: Programming Language I
<p>This course would be an introduction to the foundations of computation and purpose of mechanized computation. Emphasis will be placed on techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs. Topics will include:<br>
1. Introduction to digital computers and programming algorithms and flow chart construction.<br>
2. Information representation in digital computers. Writing, debugging and running programs (including file handling) on various digital computers using an appropriate language.<br>
3. Data structures, abstraction, recursion, iteration, as well as the design and analysis of basic algorithms.</p>

# Course Objectives

a. Develop a basic understanding of programming concepts and control structures, and demonstrate the ability to create simple flowcharts or flow diagrams using flow control design tools.

b. Demonstrate proficiency in using branching and looping structures to control program flow, and implement conditional statements and loops to solve simple problems.
c. Apply string manipulation techniques and built-in string functions to process and manipulate text data.

d. Utilize arrays to store and manipulate data, and apply different sorting algorithms to sort array elements effectively.

e. Gain hands-on experience with programming tools, including using integrated development environments (IDEs) and debugging tools, and use file I/O functions to read and write data to external files effectively and efficiently.

f. Apply problem-solving skills and critical thinking to analyze problems, design solutions, and develop working programs using appropriate programming concepts and techniques.
